1. Question
    380 - O(1) time complexity
    Q: Does my code have O(1)?
    A: hash map:  key --> list index -->  list value
    Process: redo, runtime reduced from 800+ms to 600+ms. Although still beat 5% person, time complexity should be O(1)!


2. Stared 
    18 - 4SUM

3. Stared
    454 - 4SUM II
    This solution is from a brilliant guy
    the different between 454 and 18 is that 454 only asked for the length. 

4. Problem
    981 - Time Based Key-Value Store
    Time exceeded
    A : find Max should be O(logN) binary search

5. Problem
    139 - Use DP to break string by word dictionary
    Any method without DP?
    A : ++++ recursion and memorization

6. Problem 
    140 - hard version of 139 
    test case time exceed?
    A : ++++ memorization
"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
["a","aa","aaa","aaaa","aaaaa","aaaaaa","aaaaaaa","aaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaa"]
